# Shell my laptop

Aka - set up my laptop with shell scripts.

## Getting started

Open up Terminal and run the following commands:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/workspace
cd ~/workspace
git clone https://github.com/youshy/shell-my-workstation.git
cd shell-my-workstation
```

and then run

```bash
sh setup.sh
```

## Good to know

* This script won't work properly on already used machine. Most of the stuff might work (and probably will, given that this setup is mostly based on `homebrew` but bits like `vim` setup will break.)

### Honorable mentions

* PSQL setup - [ibraheem4 gist](https://gist.github.com/ibraheem4/ce5ccd3e4d7a65589ce84f2a3b7c23a3)
